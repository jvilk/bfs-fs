# BrowserFS fs

An emulation of NodeJS's `fs` module. Used in [BrowserFS](https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS).

Currently, this repository is a simple wrapper around functionality provided in the monolithic BrowserFS library.

In the future, the actual source code of BrowserFS's `fs` implementation will be moved here.
